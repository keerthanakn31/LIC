Transient AC and DC analysis of common source ampliflier 

Introduction

A Common Source (CS) amplifier is a widely used transistor amplifier configuration where the source terminal of the transistor is common to both the input and output. The CS amplifier is known for providing high voltage gain, making it essential in many electronic circuits like audio amplifiers, RF amplifiers, and signal processing systems. In this report, we will analyze the AC and transient behavior of a CS amplifier.
The circuit consists of an NMOS transistor with a resistive load, powered by a 1.8V supply.To determine the DC biasing conditions, gain and output impedence using Transient analysis, and to find frequency response using AC analysis.
